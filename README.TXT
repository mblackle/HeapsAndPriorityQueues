PROJECT TITLE: Heaps and Priority Queues 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is an exetension to the Linked List Queue project. This program differs by certain customers having priority value higher than other existing customers with exception for the customer being currently serviced. This is simulated by utilizing a Max Heap to implement the priority queue. This program also simulates 60 minutes (iterations) of store activity. The program checks to see if new customers are added to the queue. There is a 25% chance that new customers show up and needed to be added to the queue every minute. The customer object is then updated when a customer is currently being serviced. If the customer has been fully serviced, then they are removed from the queue. During execution, when a new customer is added an output of "New customer added!. Queue length is now X" is shown to the user. Also during execution, when a customer has been completley serviced, an output of "Customer serviced and removed from the queue. Queue length is now X" is shown to the user. Finally, during execution an output of "--------------" is shown to the user to simulate a minute passing. When the simulation ends the program outputs the total number of customers serviced and the maximum line length during the simulation.
